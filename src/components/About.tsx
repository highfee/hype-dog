              Meme coins should be fun, and this project is definitely fun! Hype
              Dog is not just another meme coin though, it is a cryptocurrency
              designed to capture the essence of meme culture with its unique,
              purposely low quality, funny marketing campaign. Built on the Base
              Network, Hype Dog wants to demonstrate a commitment to
              decentralization, with a nearly complete fair launch, based on the
              token allotments below. Ownership of the contract will be
              relinquished after launch and liquidity will be locked.
